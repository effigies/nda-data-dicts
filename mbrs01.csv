Parent rarely comments on or watches child's behavior and does not engage in child's choice of activity.); 2 = Low sensitivity (Parent occasionally shows interest in the child's behavior or activity. Parent may suddenly notice where child is looking or what child is touching but does not continue to monitor child's behavior or engage in activity.); 3 = Moderate sensitivity (Parent seems to be aware of the child's interests; consistently monitors child's behavior but ignores more subtle and hard-to-detect communications from the child.); 4 = High sensitivity (Parent seems to be aware of the child's interests; consistently monitors the child's behavior but is inconsistent in detecting more subtle and hard-to-detect communications from the child.); 5 = Very high sensitivity (Parent seems to be aware of the child's interests; consistently monitors the child's behavior and follows interest indicated by subtle and hard-to-detect communications from the child.)",""

"mbrsresp3","Integer","","Recommended","MBRS Effectiveness (Reciprocity)","","1 = Very ineffective (Parent is very ineffective in keeping the child engaged in the interaction. The parent makes attempts to elicit the child's cooperation, but almost invariably fails. Most of the attempts are characterized by poor timing, lack of clarity or firmness, and/or appear to be half-hearted. Parent may give the appearance of helplessness where the child is concerned.); 2 = Ineffective (Parent mostly ineffective in keeping the child engaged in the interaction. In a few instances only, the parent is able to gain the child's cooperation, but is most often unsuccessful.); 3 = Moderately effective (Parent is successful in keeping the child engaged in the interaction but there is not reciprocal exchange of turns.); 4 = Highly effective (Parent keeps the child engaged throughout most of the interaction and often there is a reciprocal exchange of turns in play or conversation.); 5 = Extremely effective (Parent is able to keep the child engaged willingly throughout the entire interaction.

Parent may Â·show some disapproval of the child and the child's behavior but mostly remains neutral.); 3 = Accepting (This parent indicates general acceptance of the child; parent approves of the child and child's behavior in situations where approval would normally be appropriate. Moderate intensity of positive affect is displayed throughout the interaction.); 4 = Very accepting (Emphasis is on approval; this parent shows higher than average positive affect and is generous with approval.); 5 = High acceptance (This parent is effusive with approval and admiration of the child. Parent approves and praises even ordinary behavior; intense positive affect is displayed throughout the interaction.)",""

Parent does not seem to enjoy the child per se.); 3 = Pervasive enjoyment but low-intenslty (Occasionally manifests delight in child being himself.); 4 = Enjoyment is the highlight of the interaction (Enjoyment occurs in the context of a warm relaxed atmosphere. Parent manifests delight fairly frequently.); 5 = High enjoyment (Parent is noted for the buoyancy and display of joy, pleasure, delighted surprise at the child's unexpected mastery.)",""
"mbrsaffect3","Integer","","Recommended","MBRS Expressiveness","","1 = Highly inexpressive (Caregiver may inhibit body language appearing rigid; almost motionless.

May not respond to situations that would normally elicit an emotional reaction.); 3 = Moderate overt expressiveness (Parent responds to situations that would normally elicit an emotional reaction.); 4 = Overtly expressive (Parent uses body language, voice quality and facial expression in an animated manner to express emotion toward the child.

Parent's actions are simple, stereotyped and repetitive.); 2 = Small repertoire (Parent does find a few ways to engage the child in the course of the situation, but these are of limited number and tend to be repeated frequently, possibly with long periods of inactivity. Parent uses the toys in some of the standard ways, but does not seem to use other possibilities with toys or free play.); 3 = Medium repertoire (Parent performs the normal playing behaviors of parenthood, shows ability to use the standard means of playing with toys, and the usual means of free play. Parent shows some innovativeness in play and use of toys.); 4 = Large repertoire (Parent shows ability to use all the usual playing behaviors of parenthood, but in addition is able to find uses which are especially appropriate to the situation and the child's momentary needs.); 5 = Very large repertoire (Parent consistently finds new ways to use toys and/or actions to play with the child. Parent shows both standard uses of toys as well as many unusual but appropriate uses, and is continually able to change his/her behavior in response to the child's needs and state.)",""

He/she may respond with advice and criticism when help is requested but in general refrains from initiating such interaction. On the whole, this parent is cooperative and non-interfering.); 3 = Moderately directive (The parent's tendency to make suggestions and direct the child is about equal to the tendency to allow the child self-direction.
