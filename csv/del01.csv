Places/Situations In Which The Delusional Idea Is Prominent","1::3","1 = Delusional ideation is limited to a single context/place (e.g., work/home/ traveling in a subway); Paranoia is limited to home or work but does not involve hospital; Because the patient brings his/her physical self into different settings, a circumscribed somatic delusion is rated as 1;2 = The delusional ideas occur in multiple contexts or places that have common identifiable characteristics (e;g;, the neighborhood, hospital and other locations consistent with a specific delusional theme such as persecution based on ethnicity);3 = There are no defining characteristics that limit places/situations that may be involved in the beliefs","das6"
