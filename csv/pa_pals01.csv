When I was at work, I did such things as writing, typing, talking on the telephone, assembling small parts, or operating a machine that takes very little exertion or strength. If I drove a car or truck while at work, I did not lift or carry anything for more than a few minutes each day.; 3= I spent most of the day walking or using my hands and arms in work that required moderate exertion. When I was at work, I did such things as delivering mail, patrolling on guard duty, doing mechanical work on automobiles or other large machines, house painting, or operating a machine that requires some moderate-activity work of me. If I drove a truck or lift, my job required me to lift and carry things frequently.; 4= I spent most of the day lifting or carrying heavy objects or moving most of my body in some other way. When I was at work, I did such things as stacking cargo or inventory, handling parts or materials, or doing work like that of a carpenter who builds structures or a gardener who does most of the work without machines.; 5= I spent most of the day doing hard physical labor. When I was at work, I did such things as digging or chopping with heavy tools or carrying heavy loads (bricks, for example) to the place where they were to be used.

Leisure-time Activity:","1::5; 94::98; -97; -98","1= Most of my leisure time was spent without very much physical activity. I mostly did things like watching television, reading, or playing cards. If I did anything else, it was likely to be light chores around the house or yard or some easy-going game like bowling or catch. Only occasionally, no more than once or twice a month, did I do anything more vigorous, like jogging, playing tennis, or active gardening.; 2= Weekdays, when I got home from work, I did few active things, but most weekends I was able to get outdoors for some light exercise-going for walks, playing a round of golf (without motorized carts), or doing some active chores around the house.; 3= Three times per week, on average, I engaged in some moderate activity, such as brisk walking or slow jogging, swimming, or riding a bike for 15-20 minutes or more, or I spent 45 minutes to an hour or more doing moderately difficult chores, such as raking or washing windows, mowing the lawn or vacuuming, or playing games such as doubles tennis or basketball.; 4= During my leisure time over the past year, I engaged in a regular program of physical fitness involving some kind of heavy physical activity at least three times per week. Examples of heavy physical activity are jogging, running, or riding fast on a bicycle for 30 minutes or more; heavy gardening or other chores for an hour or more; active games or sports such as handball or tennis for an hour or more; or a regular program involving calisthenics and jogging or the equivalent for 30 minute or more.; 5= Over the past year, I engaged in a regular program of physical fitness along the lines described in the last paragraph, but I did it almost daily-five or more times per week.; 94=Refused to answer; 95=Do not know; 96=Missing; 97=Accidentally skipped; 98=Purposely skipped; -97=Accidentally skipped online; -98=Purposely skipped online","c_2"
