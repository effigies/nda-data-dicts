Unusually Repetitive Interests or Stereotyped Behaviors","0::3;9;-9","0 = No repetitive or stereotyped behaviors during the ADOS-2 evaluation; 1 = An interest or behavior that is repetitive or stereotyped to an unusual degree, including an intense interest in a particular toy or object, a definite interest in an unusual object or activity (odd for the child's level of motor skill), an unusually routinized activity, or a clear interest in a part of an object. This interest or behavior occurs in conjunction with several other activities and does not prevent the child from completing any ADOS-2 activities; 2 = Clearly repetitive or stereotyped interests and/or behaviors, as described above. These behaviors may form a substantial minority of the child's interests and spontaneous behaviors and may interfere with the child's ability to complete ADOS-2 activities, but it is possible for his or her attention to be directed to other objects or activities, at least momentarily; 3 = Repetitive or stereotyped interests and/or behaviors, as described above, form the majority of the child's interests, AND/OR attempts to direct his or her attention to other objects or activities are met with significant resistance and/or distress; 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS-2 activity.","URIoSB"
