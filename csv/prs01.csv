1 = Inconsistently produces two turns in a 4-turn reciprocal conversation with the examiner (see criteria for the score of '0'). Child engages in reciprocal conversation less often than expected or only easily engages in conversation on a particular topic (often this is a topic of special interest to the child). Score here if engaging the child in conversation is difficult during discussions about emotions or friends or marriage.;
2 = Difficult to ""draw out"" in conversation. Child does not spontaneously ""do his/her part"" as a conversationalist during the session.
