"cas_2","Integer","","Recommended","Ability to Relax (muscular tension)","0::4","4 = The experience of severe tension throughout much of the bodily musculature which may be accompanied by such symptoms as pain, stiffness, spasmodic contractions, and lack of control over movements. The experience is present throughout most of the waking day and there is no ability to produce relaxation at will. ;3 = As above, but the muscular tension may only be experienced in certain groups of muscles and may fluctuate in severity throughout the day. ;2 = A definite experience of muscular tension in some part of the musculature sufficient to cause some, but not severe, distress. ;1 = Slight recurrent muscular tension of which the patient is aware but which does not cause distress. Very mild degrees of tension headache or pain in other groups of muscles should be scored here. ;0 = No subjective muscular tension or of such degree which, when it occurs, can easily be controlled at will.",""
